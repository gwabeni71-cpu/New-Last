# BOLO – Music, Live TV, Movies, News & Dream Hub

One installable app by Kutullo Angel Media. All files live in one folder (no sub-folders), so they upload straight to GitHub.

## 1. Put the app online (GitHub Pages)
1. On github.com create a new repository (Public).
2. **Add file > Upload files**. Select ALL the files from this folder (including `.nojekyll`) and tap **Commit changes**.
3. **Settings > Pages > Deploy from a branch > main / (root) > Save**.
4. After about a minute your app is live at `https://YOURNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/`.
5. Open the link on your phone in Chrome and tap **Install BOLO**. On iPhone: Safari > Share > Add to Home Screen.

## 2. Switch on BOLO Insider (movie chat) safely
The secret Groq key is NOT stored in this app. It lives in a free Cloudflare Worker (`worker.js`).
1. console.groq.com > API Keys: create a NEW key.
2. dash.cloudflare.com > Workers & Pages > Create > Create Worker. Name it `bolo-insider`, Deploy, then **Edit code**, paste everything from `worker.js`, Deploy.
3. Worker > Settings > Variables and Secrets:
   - Secret `GROQ_API_KEY` = your new key
   - Text `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` = `https://YOURNAME.github.io`
4. Copy the worker address (ends in `workers.dev`). On GitHub open `movies.html`, find `const GROQ_PROXY_URL = '';`, paste the address between the quotes, Commit.

## 3. Protect your YouTube key
Google Cloud Console > Credentials > your key > Application restrictions: Websites > add `https://YOURNAME.github.io/*`. API restrictions: YouTube Data API v3 only.

## Updating
Upload the changed file with the same name. If an old version still shows, change `bolo-v4` to `bolo-v5` in `sw.js` and commit.

## Before you publish
- Open `privacy.html` and replace `[add your contact email here]` with your real email (Google Play requires a working contact).
- Only keep YouTube videos and playlists you own or have permission to use.

## Google Play (optional)
Package the live site with https://www.pwabuilder.com (Android > Google Play). Google will ask for a privacy policy link (use `https://YOURNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/privacy.html`), a content rating and a data-safety form.

## Quota safety
When the daily YouTube API limit is reached, BOLO shows the last lists it saved on the device (kept up to 30 days, the most YouTube allows). Videos themselves are always streamed from YouTube and are never downloaded or stored.
